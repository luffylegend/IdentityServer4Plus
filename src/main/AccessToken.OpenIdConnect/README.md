## About IdentityServer4.AccessToken.OpenIdConnect
IdentityServer4.AccessToken.OpenIdConnect is a .NET library that manages OpenId
Connect access tokens in [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)
applications. It will acquire new tokens when old tokens are about to expire, provides conveniences to 
automatically use the current token with HTTP clients, and can revoke refresh tokens that are no longer needed.
