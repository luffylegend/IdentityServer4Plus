## About IdentityServer4.AccessToken
IdentityServer4.AccessToken is a .NET library that manages OAuth
access tokens in [.NET workers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/workers) 
and [ASP.NET Core worker services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services).
It will acquire new tokens when old tokens are about to expire and provides conveniences to 
automatically use the current token with HTTP clients.
